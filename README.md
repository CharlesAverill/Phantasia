# Phantasia
Multiplatform Final Fantasy 1 port in Unity

## Installation
Download the repo as a zip file (green button at the top right). Open the "Builds" folder.
- Mac - Run Phantasia.app
- Windows - Run Phantasia.exe inside of "Windows"
- Linux - Run "Phantasia.x86_64" inside of "Linux"

## Tips
- Pressing "m" on the title screen will switch between classic/remastered music. This will carry across sessions.
- Pressing "escape" will unlock the mouse
- Damge IS happening when you're battling, both to you and the monsters. I just haven't messed around with the UI yet
- The game autosaves your party's HP, EXP, and conditions at the end of each battle. If you want to save your overworld/subword position, press "i".
