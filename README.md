# Phantasia
FF1 Remake in Unity

## Installation
- Mac - Download the Phantasia.app folder and run it as an application
- Windows - Download the "Windows Build" folder and run the .exe inside

## Tips
- Pressing "escape" will unlock the mouse
- Don't be surprised if it crashes if you have a random encounter far away from Corneria, I haven't added in those monster parties yet
